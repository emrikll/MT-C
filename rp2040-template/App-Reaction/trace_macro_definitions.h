trace macro are defined before their default implementations that are contained
in FreeRTOS.h.
 
Note: This example makes direct use of consoleprint() from within
traceTASK_SWITCHED_OUT() and traceTASK_SWITCHED_IN(), even though these two
macros are called from an interrupt service routine.  This is done to make this
trivial example as easy to follow and as generic as possible.  However,
consoleprint() has the potential to take a long time to execute, might require
a large stack, and could access resources that should not be accessed
simultaneously by tasks and interrupts.  For these reasons, text or file based
output functions (especially printf()) should not be called from an interrupt
service routine in a real application. */

output text.  The scheduler locking API functions are used in macros that are
called in the context of a task to ensure mutually exclusive access to
cBuffer[] is maintained at all times.  This is a safe mutual exclusion
mechanism in this case, because the macros that are called in the context of an
interrupt are only called in the tick interrupt, and will therefore not be
executed if the scheduler is locked. */

obtain the task names directly from the TCB structures. */
